#
# This file documents what dependencies we WOULD use if the stdlib-only
# constraint were lifted. It is NOT used in the actual implementation.
#
# See README.md section "Python Backend: Standard Library Only" for rationale.

# HTTP framework - replaces http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
# Provides: better error handling, routing, templates, production-ready server
flask>=3.0.0

# Date/time parsing - replaces manual string parsing of --since argument
# Provides: robust parsing of relative dates ("2 weeks ago", "last Tuesday")
python-dateutil>=2.8.2

# HTTP client library - if backend needs to query external APIs
# Provides: better error handling, retries, connection pooling
requests>=2.31.0

# Configuration file support - replaces CLI-only configuration
# Provides: YAML config files as alternative to command-line arguments
pyyaml>=6.0

# Enhanced CLI argument parsing - replaces argparse
# Provides: better validation, type coercion, help text formatting
click>=8.1.0

# Note: These dependencies would improve developer experience but would
# break zero-dependency deployment, which is a core design goal.
