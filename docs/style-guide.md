# Style Guide: Dark Mode Financial Terminal

## 1. Aesthetic

A dark, muted, and utilitarian interface inspired by professional financial trading terminals. Focus is on dense data presentation, clarity, and low-eye-strain readability over long periods. The design is flat, matte, and devoid of glossy effects.

## 3. Typography

- **Font**: Exclusively monospaced fonts (e.g., Consolas, Fira Code, IBM Plex Mono, Roboto Mono) to maintain data alignment.
- **Weight**: Regular or Medium. Bold is used sparingly for key metrics.
- **Styling**: Headings often in uppercase. Data and body text in mixed case.

## 4. Layout Structure

- **Bento Grid**: The interface is composed of distinct, modular rectangular panels (like a bento box) separated by thin dark borders with minimal padding.
- **Panel Styling**: Panels have sharp or slightly rounded corners (max 4px radius) and matte surfaces. No gradients or deep shadows.
- **Sidebar**: A fixed left sidebar for controls and filters (Time Range, Status, Search, Navigation).
- **Main Content**: The central area features data visualizations (e.g., GANTT chart, tables) and top-level metric tiles arranged in a grid.

## 5. Components

- **Buttons/Inputs**: Flat, rectangular, with solid color fills or outlines. Hover effects are subtle brightness changes.
- **Data Viz**: Clean, flat charts with thin lines. Bars and points use the muted olive and rust colors.
- **Icons**: Simple, flat, single-color glyphs.
